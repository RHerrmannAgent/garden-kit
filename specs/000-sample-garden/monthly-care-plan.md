| May | Late Spring | Transplant tomatoes/peppers; install trellises; hang bee hotel | Beds A2, pergola, Zone C | Trellis kit, mallet, bee hotel hardware | Priya | Warm-season crops established | Finish before heatwave |
| June | Early Summer | Refresh mulch, install shade cloth, brew compost tea | Zones A & B | Wheelbarrow, shade cloth, brewer | Volunteers | Beds protected from heat stress | Monitor soil moisture twice weekly |
| July | Mid Summer | Deadhead pollinator strips; harvest herbs for drying; inspect drip lines | Beds A4, pergola | Snips, drying rack, bucket | Jamie | Continuous blooms, herbs stored | Perform before weekend gatherings |
| August | Late Summer | Sow fall crops, apply compost tea, prep buckwheat cover crop | Beds A1 & A3 | Hoe, watering can, seed | Priya | Fall succession germinated | Schedule irrigation flush post-sowing |
