# Tasks: Sample Pollinator Kitchen Garden

**Inputs**: spec.md, plan.md, site-research.md, existing-plant-inventory.md, planting-schema.md, seasonal-calendar.md, monthly-care-plan.md, 	ools.md  
**Prerequisites**: Constitution check complete, tree protection installed, tool inventory verified.

---

## Format: [ID] [P?] [Phase/Scenario?] Description

- [P] marks work that can run in parallel without tool or space conflicts.
- Phase labels (PH0, PH1, SC1, etc.) map tasks to plan sections.
- Reference exact beds/zones and required tools to avoid ambiguity.

---

## Phase 0: Site Preparation (Shared Infrastructure)

- [ ] T001 PH0 Sheet mulch lawn area with cardboard and arborist chips (requires wheelbarrow, spade)
- [ ] T002 [P] PH0 Grade and level main path (requires spirit level, tamper)
- [ ] T003 PH0 Assemble rain barrel pad and secure diverter (requires drill, level)
- [ ] T004 [P] PH0 Collect soil samples for raised beds and log results (requires trowel, sample bags)
- [ ] T005 PH0 Install root protection fencing around maple and serviceberry per existing-plant-inventory.md (requires stakes, signage)

---

## Phase 1: Structural Build (Blocking Prerequisites)

- [ ] T006 PH1 Assemble cedar beds with hardware cloth bottoms (requires driver, tin snips)
- [ ] T007 [P] PH1 Set pergola posts and beams with concrete footings (requires post-hole digger)
- [ ] T008 PH1 Lay and compact 2.5 m gravel path from gate to pergola (requires compactor)
- [ ] T009 [P] PH1 Install drip mainline and valves in Zones A and C (requires pipe cutter)
- [ ] T010 PH1 Relocate thyme and chives flagged for preservation (requires transplant spade)

**Checkpoint**: Beds, pergola, and infrastructure established; relocation tasks complete before planting.

---

## Phase 2: Scenario 1 – Morning Harvest Walk (Priority: P1)

- [ ] T011 [P] SC1 Flush drip lines in Zone A until water runs clear (requires bucket)
- [ ] T012 SC1 Fill beds A1–A3 with soil/compost mix and inoculate with mycorrhizae (requires wheelbarrow)
- [ ] T013 [P] SC1 Plant salad greens, basil, and tomato transplants per planting-schema.md spacing (requires trowel)
- [ ] T014 SC1 Install insect netting on Bed A1 using hoops and clips (requires clamps)
- [ ] T015 SC1 Mulch beds with 5 cm arborist chips (requires garden fork)

**Checkpoint**: Zone A irrigated, planted, mulched, and ready for daily harvest.

---

## Phase 3: Scenario 2 – Sunset Pollinator Lounge (Priority: P2)

- [ ] T016 [P] SC2 Test lighting levels under pergola at dusk; adjust solar panels (requires lux meter)
- [ ] T017 SC2 Plant climbing roses and clematis at pergola posts with compost backfill (requires pruners, compost)
- [ ] T018 [P] SC2 Arrange seating, secure solar lighting, and run low-voltage cables (requires screwdriver)
- [ ] T019 SC2 Install pollinator water basin and bee hotel per plan (requires drill)

**Checkpoint**: Pergola lounge ready; evening pollinator activity supported.

---

## Phase 4: Scenario 3 – Winter Pantry Refill (Priority: P3)

- [ ] T020 [P] SC3 Plant berry hedge along fence with 1 m spacing (requires trench spade)
- [ ] T021 SC3 Build storage bins in shed for cured squash/root crops (requires saw, screws)
- [ ] T022 [P] SC3 Set up curing racks in pergola shade and log schedule in monthly-care-plan.md (requires clipboards)

**Checkpoint**: Storage infrastructure in place; berry hedge planted with protection netting queued.

---

## Phase 5: Stewardship & Seasonal Care

- [ ] T023 STEW Schedule weekly observation walk and update seasonal-calendar.md (requires notebook)
- [ ] T024 [P] STEW Review upcoming month in monthly-care-plan.md and confirm responsible gardeners
- [ ] T025 STEW Sharpen and oil hand tools; update maintenance log in 	ools.md (requires sharpening kit)
- [ ] T026 [P] STEW Update volunteer quickstart guide with safety reminders (requires laptop)
- [ ] T027 STEW Verify tree protection fencing and mulch depth around preserved specimens (existing-plant-inventory.md)

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

- Phase 0 must complete before structural work begins.
- Scenario phases depend on irrigation and infrastructure established in Phase 1.
- Stewardship tasks run continuously once scenarios deliver initial outcomes.

### Parallel Opportunities

- Soil amendments (T001) and path grading (T002) can run concurrently with separate crews.
- Drip installation (T009) can proceed while pergola hardscape sets (T008) if tools are available.
- Scenario tasks marked [P] can run in parallel when they do not compete for the same tools or zones.

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Scenario 1)
1. Complete Phase 0 and Phase 1 tasks.
2. Execute Scenario 1 tasks (T011–T015).
3. Observe and log results before expanding work.

### Incremental Delivery
- Deliver Scenario 2 after pergola completion.
- Deliver Scenario 3 once storage infrastructure is ready.

### Parallel Team Approach
- Team A: Site preparation & bed assembly.
- Team B: Pergola, irrigation, and lounge setup.
- Team C: Berry hedge planting & storage readiness.

## Notes

- Cross-check 	ools.md and existing-plant-inventory.md before scheduling work that disturbs established roots.
- Use this sample as a reference; regenerate tasks for new gardens with /gardenkit.tasks.
- Document lessons learned in seasonal-calendar.md, monthly-care-plan.md, or quickstart.md.
- Update 	ools.md whenever tools are borrowed, replaced, or returned.
