# Established Plant Inventory: Sample Pollinator Kitchen Garden

**Survey Date**: 2025-10-10  
**Surveyed By**: Jamie Lee  
**Overall Notes**: Preserve mature maple and serviceberry; relocate herbs before pergola build; remove barberry near future lounge.

| Category | Common Name | Botanical Name | Location / Bed | Size & Age | Health | Seasonal Interest | Keep / Relocate / Remove | Notes |
|----------|-------------|----------------|----------------|------------|--------|-------------------|--------------------------|-------|
| Tree     | Sugar Maple | *Acer saccharum* | West boundary | 9 m tall, planted ~1998 | Thriving | Shade canopy, fall colour | Keep | Install root protection fencing before digging |
| Shrub    | Serviceberry | *Amelanchier alnifolia* | Rain garden edge (Zone C) | 2.5 m tall, ~5 yrs | Healthy | Spring bloom, berries for birds | Keep | Mulch to retain moisture |
| Shrub    | Japanese Barberry | *Berberis thunbergii* | Future pergola corner | 1.2 m tall, unknown age | Fair | Minimal | Remove | Remove before pergola build (March) |
| Perennial| Thyme clump | *Thymus vulgaris* | Existing patio bed | 40 cm spread, 4 yrs | Good | Spring bloom, culinary | Relocate | Transplant to Bed A1 edge |
| Perennial| Chives | *Allium schoenoprasum* | Existing patio bed | 30 cm, 4 yrs | Good | Spring bloom, culinary | Relocate | Move to container near kitchen door |

## Root Zone & Protection

- Maple: Critical root zone radius 4.3 m; no trenching or heavy machinery inside this radius.
- Serviceberry: Mulch 5 cm depth; avoid compaction around rain garden edge.

## Soil / Microclimate Implications

- Maple canopy creates afternoon shade across pergola; adjust understory plant palette accordingly.
- Existing barberry has compacted soil; aerate after removal before installing lounge surface.

## Integration Notes

- Companion planting near maple limited to shade-tolerant species (hosta, ferns).
- Relocated thyme and chives become edging plants for Bed A1 to support quick harvest access.
- Berry hedge will tie into existing serviceberry flowering period for extended wildlife forage.

## Follow-Up Actions

- [ ] Install protection fencing (T005) prior to site preparation.
- [ ] Schedule barberry removal and stump grinding with arborist (March).
- [ ] Transplant herbs the week before bed assembly; water-in thoroughly.
