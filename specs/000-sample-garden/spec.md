## Garden Scenarios & Seasonal Experiences *(mandatory)*

### Scenario 1 – Morning Harvest Walk (Priority: P1)

Household members harvest herbs and greens each morning without mud or crowding.

**Why it matters**: Provides fresh produce daily and invites gentle observation of the garden.

**Independent Observation**: Raised beds remain accessible and produce at least three harvest-ready crops most days between April and October.

**Seasonal Markers**:
1. **Spring** – Lettuce, peas, and herbs thrive; paths stay dry after rain.
2. **Summer** – Tomatoes, peppers, and basil ready for daily picking.
3. **Autumn/Winter** – Cold frames extend greens into December.

### Scenario 2 – Sunset Pollinator Lounge (Priority: P2)

Friends gather under the pergola while bees and butterflies enjoy nectar-rich blooms around them.

**Why it matters**: Celebrates biodiversity and turns the garden into a communal space.

**Independent Observation**: At least five pollinator species observed weekly from May through September without disturbing seating areas.

**Seasonal Markers**:
1. **Spring** – Early bulbs and flowering shrubs welcome emerging pollinators.
2. **Summer** – Coneflowers, bee balm, and salvia bloom in succession.
3. **Autumn/Winter** – Seed heads left for birds; ornamental grasses provide movement.

### Scenario 3 – Winter Pantry Refill (Priority: P3)

Stored crops and preserved herbs are accessible in winter with minimal spoilage.

**Why it matters**: Extends garden value beyond the main growing season.

**Independent Observation**: Root cellar bins hold carrots, potatoes, and winter squash through February with <10% losses.

**Seasonal Markers**:
1. **Spring** – Plan storage rotation and sanitize bins.
2. **Summer** – Schedule harvest and cure dates for storage crops.
3. **Autumn/Winter** – Monthly inspection log prevents spoilage.

### Edge Conditions

- What happens during multi-week summer droughts? Drip irrigation and mulch maintain soil moisture.
- How does the garden respond if deer pressure increases? Deploy deer netting around berry hedge.
- What is the contingency plan during municipal water restrictions? Prioritize rainwater capture and greywater buckets.

## Garden Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Site Requirements

- **SR-001**: Raised beds in Zone A maintain 40 cm soil depth with annual compost top-up.
- **SR-002**: Main path from house to pergola remains at least 1.2 m wide with permeable gravel.
- **SR-003**: Rainwater harvesting system stores minimum 400 L with overflow directed to rain garden.
- **SR-004**: Shade sail installed above pergola between June and August to manage afternoon heat.
- **SR-005**: Cold frames secured against winter winds with quick-release hinges.

### Planting & Habitat Requirements

- **PH-001**: Each bloom month (March–October) includes at least three nectar sources and one larval host plant.
- **PH-002**: Companion planting around tomatoes includes basil, marigold, and garlic chives to deter pests.
- **PH-003**: Berry hedge along north fence provides staggered fruiting from June through September.
- **PH-004**: Fallen leaves retained in Zone C beds over winter for habitat.

### Stewardship Requirements

- **ST-001**: Mulch depth maintained at 5 cm in all beds; replenish twice per year.
- **ST-002**: Weekly harvest log tracks yields and notes pest sightings.
- **ST-003**: Pergola structure inspected each spring; wood resealed every three years.
- **ST-004**: Compost bins turned monthly; temperature logged to ensure active decomposition.

## Key Elements & Features

- **Raised Cedar Beds**: Four 1.2 m × 3 m beds in Zone A, 40 cm deep, drip irrigated.
- **Pergola Lounge**: 3 m × 3 m seating area with hanging lights and climbing roses.
- **Berry Hedge**: Mix of raspberries, currants, and elderberry along north fence with wildlife-friendly gaps.
- **Rain Garden**: Swale at southwest corner capturing overflow from cistern.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Harvest at least 35 kg of produce between April and October.
- **SC-002**: Record activity from 15 distinct pollinator species during peak season.
- **SC-003**: Reduce municipal water usage by 50% compared to baseline summer consumption.
- **SC-004**: Achieve 90% satisfaction from guests in biannual feedback survey.

### Observation Log Prompts

- Note first bloom and last harvest dates for primary crops.
- Log weekly pollinator sightings with species or description.
- Record soil moisture readings after irrigation cycles.

## Assumptions

- Two adults available for daily care, plus monthly volunteer work party.
- Budget includes annual allowance for compost delivery and mulch.
- Existing mature maple provides afternoon shade on west side.

## Open Questions

1. Confirm local ordinance allowance for rainwater cistern height.
2. Decide whether pergola lighting should be solar or low-voltage wired.
3. Determine supplier for elderberry cultivars suited to local climate.
