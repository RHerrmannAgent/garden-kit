# Established Plant Inventory: [GARDEN NAME]

Document every existing plant, tree, shrub, and perennial feature before planning new work. Include legacy plantings, volunteer specimens worth keeping, and any protected or heritage trees.

## Summary

- **Survey Date**: [DATE]
- **Surveyed By**: [NAME]
- **Overall Notes**: [High-level observations, soil implications, conflicts, or preservation requirements]

*Tips*:
- **Location**: reference plan grid, GPS point, or descriptive marker.
- **Size & Age**: height, spread, caliper, estimated planting year.
- **Health**: thriving, moderate, stressed; include pest/disease notes if relevant.
- **Seasonal Interest**: bloom time, fall colour, winter structure, edible yield.
- **Decision**: mark if plant must be preserved, can be relocated, or should be removed. Note timing constraints.

## Root Zone & Protection Notes

- [Tree/Plant] — [Critical root zone radius, protection methods during construction]
- [Tree/Plant] — [Any legal protection, permits needed for removal]

## Soil / Microclimate Implications

- [Existing plant influence on shade, moisture, or soil composition]
- [Areas where roots will impede digging, trenching, or irrigation lines]

## Integration Considerations

- **Companion Candidates**: [List new plant types that complement existing specimens]
- **Conflict Risks**: [List features that may be overcrowded or compete for resources]
- **Wildlife Value**: [Document habitat or food sources needing preservation]

## Follow-Up Actions

- [Action] — [Owner / volunteer / contractor] — [Timing]
- [Action] — [Owner / volunteer / contractor] — [Timing]

Keep this document updated after plant removals, relocations, or new plantings so future planning sessions remain accurate.
