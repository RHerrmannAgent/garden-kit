# GardenKit Constitution

## Core Principles

### 1. Observe Before You Design
Every garden plan begins with a grounded understanding of the site. Document sun and shade patterns across seasons, drainage behavior after heavy rain, soil texture and fertility, existing vegetation, utilities, and access points before proposing any layout choices.

### 2. Zones With Purpose
Divide the garden into zones that each have a single dominant purpose (growing food, pollinator habitat, gathering, storage, compost, etc.). Surface the needs, constraints, and success measures for every zone so selections stay intentional and easy to maintain.

### 3. Seasonal Rhythm Matters
Design for year-round usefulness. Capture planting and harvest windows, rotation plans, succession plantings, and off-season cover strategies so the garden stays productive, resilient, and visually coherent throughout the year.

### 4. Steward Soil, Water, and Time
Prioritize regenerative practices. Plans must specify soil-building methods, water conservation (mulch, rain capture, efficient irrigation), and realistic maintenance commitments. Recommendations that exceed available effort or resources are not acceptable.

### 5. Grow Incrementally
Always articulate a phased journey from today’s conditions to the desired garden. Each phase must deliver visible progress, avoid rework, and be achievable within the indicated season, budget, and labor capacity.

## Site Design Standards

- Capture site measurements, slope observations, microclimates, and neighboring influences in diagrams and notes.
- Flag hazards and no-dig zones (utilities, tree roots, setbacks) before suggesting hardscaping or deep digging.
- Present bed shapes, paths, and structures with clear dimensions and spacing guidelines that respect accessibility standards.
- Document water sources, storage volumes, and distribution methods; include contingency plans for drought or excess rain.
- Provide soil improvement recipes that match identified deficiencies (organic matter, pH, drainage) and outline amendment timelines.

## Planning Workflow

1. **Vision & Priorities** – Confirm the gardener’s goals, aesthetics, available time, and budget.
2. **Site Study Pack** – Produce maps and notes covering measurements, exposure, soil tests, and existing assets.
3. **Concept Layout** – Draft annotated diagrams showing zones, flow of movement, and focal points.
4. **Planting Strategy** – Recommend plant palettes per zone, including companions, succession plans, and wildlife considerations.
5. **Phasing & Calendar** – Break delivery into seasonal phases with task bundles, tool lists, cost estimates, and checkpoints.
6. **Care Guides** – Supply maintenance routines, harvest guidance, and signals that indicate the plan is succeeding or needs adjustment.

Each step builds on prior work; do not skip prerequisites. Every artifact must reference the constitution to confirm compliance (e.g., note how phasing honors labor limits, or how plant selections support stated goals).

## Governance

- The constitution overrides ad-hoc preferences when conflicts arise; deviations require an explicit amendment.
- Amendments must include rationale, impact analysis, and updates to dependent templates or prompts within one planning cycle.
- Version numbers follow semantic intent: MAJOR for principle changes, MINOR for new sections or major additions, PATCH for clarifications.
- Record ratification and amendment dates using ISO 8601. When in doubt, document assumptions and surface them for confirmation before finalizing deliverables.
