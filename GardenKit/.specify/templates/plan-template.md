# Garden Implementation Plan: [GARDEN PLAN NAME]

**Branch**: `[###-garden-plan]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Vision**: [link to spec]
**Input**: Garden vision from `/specs/[###-garden-plan]/spec.md`

**Usage**: Generated by `/speckit.plan`. This file orchestrates supporting artifacts (`site-study.md`, `layout-guide.md`, `planting-calendar.md`, `care-guide.md`, and `structures/` sketches).

## Summary

[Concise restatement of primary goals, headline layout idea, and biggest risks or opportunities uncovered during planning.]

## Site & Context Recap

| Sunlight & Microclimates | [Sun map insights] | [...] |
| Soil Health | [Test results, amendments needed] | [...] |
| Water & Drainage | [Irrigation approach, drainage fixes] | [...] |
| Existing Assets | [Trees, sheds, views to preserve] | [...] |
| Constraints | [Setbacks, HOA rules, pets, budget caps] | [...] |

## Constitution Check

## Design Blueprint

### Zones Overview

| Zone | Priority | Size & Placement | Main Elements | Dependencies |
|------|----------|-----------------|---------------|--------------|
| [Zone 1] | P1 | [Dimensions] | [Beds, seating, etc.] | [e.g., requires French drain installed] |
| [Zone 2] | P2 | [...] | [...] | [...] |
| [Zone 3] | P3 | [...] | [...] | [...] |

### Circulation & Access

- Paths & surfacing: [Materials, widths, slope considerations]
- Equipment movement: [Wheelbarrow routes, gate widths]
- Accessibility notes: [Raised bed heights, seating clearances]

### Water & Soil Strategy

- Irrigation layout: [Method, zoning, controls]
- Rain capture: [Barrels, cisterns, overflow paths]
- Soil building timelines: [Amendment recipe, application schedule]

## Supporting Artifacts

| Artifact | Purpose | Owner | Status |
|----------|---------|-------|--------|
| `site-study.md` | Detailed observations, clarifications to resolve | `/speckit.plan` Phase 0 | [Draft/In progress/Complete] |
| `layout-guide.md` | Zone-by-zone specs, dimensions, material takeoffs | Phase 1 | [...] |
| `structures/` | Sketches or patterns for beds, trellises, water systems | Phase 1 | [...] |
| `planting-calendar.md` | Succession plan, rotations, seasonal highlights | Phase 1 | [...] |
| `care-guide.md` | Maintenance routines, cues for success, troubleshooting | Phase 1 | [...] |
| `tasks.md` | Executable task list (from `/speckit.tasks`) | Phase 2 | Pending |

## Phasing Roadmap

Break the plan into seasonal, independently valuable phases that respect resource limits.

### Phase 0 – Site Study & Clarifications

- Confirm outstanding measurements, utilities, soil tests.
- Document sun/shade charts and drainage photos.
- Deliver `site-study.md` with decisions and open questions resolved.

### Phase 1 – Infrastructure & Hardscape

- Install grading fixes, edging, paths, primary irrigation.
- Build raised beds/planters, compost area, water storage.
- Capture diagrams or templates in `structures/`.

### Phase 2 – Planting Foundations (P1 Zones)

- Prepare soil per amendment schedule.
- Install primary plantings for Zone 1 (include succession plan).
- Update `layout-guide.md` and `planting-calendar.md` with actual selections.

### Phase 3 – Habitat & Experience Layers (P2/P3 Zones)

- Add pollinator, shade, or gathering zones.
- Install vertical elements, lighting, seating if applicable.
- Validate plant combinations and seasonal continuity.

### Phase 4 – Care & Iteration

- Document weekly/monthly care in `care-guide.md`.
- Set checkpoints to review soil health, harvest targets, wildlife pressure.
- Capture lessons for future amendments or expansions.

## Resource Plan

- **Budget Allocation**: [Table of costs by phase/zone]
- **Labor Timeline**: [Hours per phase, volunteers vs. hired help]
- **Tool & Material List**: [Required tools, rental needs, bulk material sources]
- **Risk Register**: [Weather constraints, supply delays, pest outbreaks with mitigation]

## Evaluation Gates

Before moving to the next phase, confirm:

- All constitution requirements for current phase satisfied.
- Outstanding clarifications resolved or scheduled.
- Resource plan adjusted for new information.
- Maintenance commitments remain achievable.
