# Garden Tasks: [GARDEN PLAN NAME]

**Input**: Planning documents from `/specs/[###-garden-plan]/`  
**Prerequisites**: `plan.md` (required), `site-study.md`, `layout-guide.md`, `planting-calendar.md`, `care-guide.md`

**Organization**: Group tasks so each phase and zone produces visible progress. Tie every item back to constitution principles (observations, purposeful zones, seasonal rhythm, stewardship, incremental growth).

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Zone/Phase] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (no shared resources or site conflicts)
- **[Zone/Phase]**: Label with phase (P0–P4) and zone (e.g., Z1, Z2) for traceability
- Include exact locations, measurements, or file references in every task

<!--
  ============================================================================
  IMPORTANT: Replace every example with real tasks based on the actual plan.
  Keep tasks specific, measurable, and tied to constitution principles.
  ============================================================================
-->

## Phase 0 – Site Study & Clarifications

**Purpose**: Confirm assumptions before any construction or planting.

- [ ] T001 [P0] Flag and mark underground utilities; add map to `site-study.md`
- [ ] T002 [P0] Capture sun/shade photos (8 am, noon, 4 pm) for each zone
- [ ] T003 [P? P0] Collect soil samples (top + subsoil) and submit for lab analysis
- [ ] T004 [P0] Document drainage observations after rainfall; update risk table

**Checkpoint**: All clarifications resolved and incorporated into `site-study.md`.

## Phase 1 – Infrastructure & Hardscape

**Purpose**: Build shared elements that all zones rely on.

- [ ] T010 [P1 Z*] Excavate and install French drain along north fence (per plan dimensions)
- [ ] T011 [P? P1 Z*] Lay 36" crushed-gravel path from gate to patio; compact to grade
- [ ] T012 [P1 Z1] Assemble three 4'x8' cedar beds (18" high); capture cut list in `structures/`
- [ ] T013 [P1 ZC] Set up 200-gal rainwater system with overflow to drain; test flow
- [ ] T014 [P1] Update budget tracking sheet with actual spend for infrastructure

**Checkpoint**: Hardscape inspected, level, and ready for soil preparation.

## Phase 2 – Planting Foundations (Priority Zone)

**Zone Focus**: [Zone 1 name]

- [ ] T020 [P2 Z1] Fill raised beds with 40/30/30 soil mix; record volumes used
- [ ] T021 [P? P2 Z1] Install drip irrigation with timer; log schedule in `care-guide.md`
- [ ] T022 [P2 Z1] Direct sow cool-season crops per `planting-calendar.md`
- [ ] T023 [P2 Z1] Mulch paths with shredded bark (3" depth) to suppress weeds
- [ ] T024 [P? P2 Z1] Capture initial plant spacing diagram; store in `layout-guide.md`

**Validation**

- [ ] T025 [P2 Z1] Verify irrigation delivers 1" of water in 45 minutes (bucket test)
- [ ] T026 [P2 Z1] Soil moisture spot check 48 hours post-watering; adjust timer if needed

**Checkpoint**: Zone 1 productive and independently maintainable.

---

## Phase 3 – Habitat & Experience Layers

**Zone Focus**: [Zone 2 name]

- [ ] T030 [P3 Z2] Sheet mulch 200 sq ft lawn; log layers and depths
- [ ] T031 [P3 Z2] Plant pollinator perennials per companion chart; track bloom succession
- [ ] T032 [P? P3 Z2] Install seating pad (6'x6' pavers); check slope and stability
- [ ] T033 [P3 Z2] Add solar lighting along path; update maintenance notes
- [ ] T034 [P3 Z2] Record wildlife-support checklist (nectar weeks, host plants)

**Checkpoint**: Zone 2 delivers habitat and gathering experience as planned.

---

## Phase 4 – Care, Calibration, and Expansion

**Purpose**: Lock in maintenance rhythms and prep optional zones.

- [ ] T040 [P4] Draft weekly/monthly care schedule in `care-guide.md`
- [ ] T041 [P4] Set compost rotation markers and log turn dates
- [ ] T042 [P? P4] Evaluate soil aggregation and worm counts quarterly
- [ ] T043 [P4] Conduct end-of-season review; update success metrics in plan.md
- [ ] T044 [P4 Z3] Draft expansion notes or future enhancements for Zone 3

---

## Dependencies & Sequencing

- **Phase 0** gates all later work; do not proceed with construction until checks complete.
- **Phase 1** must finish before planting to avoid damaging new infrastructure.
- Zones can run in parallel only when they do not compete for workers/tools or violate access routes.
- Observational tasks (soil tests, irrigation validation) follow immediately after related work.

## Parallel Opportunities

- Multiple raised beds can be assembled simultaneously when materials are staged.
- Planting in separate zones may proceed in parallel when irrigation systems are independent.
- Documentation tasks (`layout-guide.md`, `planting-calendar.md`, `care-guide.md`) can be handled by a dedicated recorder while physical work continues.

## Notes

- Keep descriptions actionable and measurable (dimensions, quantities, deliverables).
- Highlight safety, permit, or specialized skill requirements.
- Reference constitution principles directly when they influence decisions.
- Update linked documents as work completes; treat documentation as part of the task definition.
