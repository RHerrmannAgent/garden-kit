# Garden-Driven Planning (GDP)

GDP also inventories existing trees, shrubs, and perennials in `existing-plant-inventory.md`. This record protects legacy specimens, flags relocation candidates, and influences shade, soil, and irrigation planning before new work begins.


Garden-Driven Planning adapts the rigor of specification-led work to the living system of a garden. Instead of treating planting as a spontaneous weekend project, GDP treats every garden as a story that unfolds through structured artefacts. Each document guides the next stage of transformationâ€”from idea to thriving landscapeâ€”while staying accessible to gardeners, volunteers, and AI assistants.

## 1. Vision Over Impulse

Gardens succeed when intent is captured clearly. GDP begins with a **Garden Vision**: a document written in everyday language that articulates the gardenerâ€™s goals, site character, desired experiences, and success measures. Vision files avoid technical jargonâ€”they describe how the space should feel through the seasons, who will enjoy it, and the constraints nature has set.

### Vision Checklist
- Clarify the purpose of each zone (relaxation, pollinator support, food production).
- Note existing assets (mature trees, slopes, water sources).
- Document any constraints (HOA rules, water restrictions, wildlife pressure).
- Define how success will be measured (yield, biodiversity, community engagement).

Every decision downstream traces back to this document.

## 2. Research Before Design

Once intent is captured, GDP calls for **Site Research**. This is not an academic exercise; it is practical reconnaissance that anchors the plan in reality. Soil tests, sunlight mapping, microclimates, pest pressures, and irrigation capacity are recorded in `site-research.md`. Research resolves unknowns flagged in the vision and informs plant selection and layout.

### Research Output
- Soil texture, pH, and nutrient levels.
- Sunlight windows for each bed or zone.
- Climate considerations (frost dates, heatwaves, prevailing winds).
- Accessibility notes and community guidelines.
- Observations about local wildlife and pollinator activity.

## 3. Intent Becomes Layout

With research in hand, GDP produces the **Garden Layout Plan** (`plan.md`). This is where the space is translated into zones, paths, planting layers, and infrastructure. The plan preserves natural language while setting clear expectations for materials, sequencing, and care.

### Plan Components
- **Site Conditions** â€“ soil amendments, grading needs, drainage strategies.
- **Garden Map** â€“ shapes of beds, paths, gathering areas, water features.
- **Planting Schema** â€“ anchor plants, understory layers, succession plans.
- **Resource Inventory** â€“ time, budget, volunteers, and crucially, **available tools**.
- **Seasonal Strategy** â€“ what happens in spring, summer, autumn, and winter.


GDP also inventories existing trees, shrubs, and perennials in `existing-plant-inventory.md`. This record protects legacy specimens, flags relocation candidates, and influences shade, soil, and irrigation planning before new work begins.

GDP requires the gardener to list every tool on handâ€”hoes, pruners, rakes, irrigation timers, even protective gear. This inventory powers validation in later phases.

## 4. Tasks That Respect Nature

The plan flows into **Tasks** (`tasks.md`) that gardeners and assistants can execute. GDP emphasises:

1. **Phased Workflows** â€“ Preparation, planting, maintenance, and seasonal resets.
2. **Tool-Aware Scheduling** â€“ No task is generated without confirming the required tools exist.
3. **Independent Work Packages** â€“ Each phase can be completed and evaluated before moving on.
4. **Safety and Stewardship** â€“ Reminders about PPE, wildlife considerations, and water conservation.

Tasks are linked back to plan sections, making it easy to adjust if conditions change.

## 5. Implementation with Feedback Loops

Execution is not the end. GDP views implementation as a cycle:

1. **Prepare** using the tasks list, logging observations as you go.
2. **Adapt** when weather or plant responses differ from the plan.
3. **Record** adjustments in the plan and vision for future seasons.
4. **Share** insights with collaborators and assistants so the gardenâ€™s story stays current.

Because every artefact is plain-language, new caretakers can step in mid-season without guesswork.

## 6. Role of AI Assistants

Garden Kit integrates multiple AI assistants to accelerate each stage:
- Summarise soil research into actionable amendments.
- Draft planting schemas based on sun requirements and desired palettes.
- Suggest seasonal maintenance tasks based on regional data.
- Rewrite documents for different audiences (community boards, volunteers, clients).

Assistants follow strict templates, ensuring the garden remains grounded in real conditions.

## 7. Living Documentation

A GDP project folder becomes a time capsule of the gardenâ€™s life:
- `spec.md` â€“ vision and desired experiences.
- `spec.md` – vision and desired experiences.
- `plan.md` – layout, materials, and sequencing.
- `site-research.md` – environmental facts and findings.
- `existing-plant-inventory.md` – legacy plant catalogue and protection notes.
- `planting-schema.md` – plant lists, spacing, companions.
- `seasonal-calendar.md` – month-by-month reminders.
- `monthly-care-plan.md` – detailed work programme by month.
- `tools.md` – inventory powering task validation.
- `tasks.md` – actionable work orders.

By updating these artefacts, gardeners evolve the space with confidence, season after season.

Gardens are never static. Garden-Driven Planning honours this truth by coupling intentional design with adaptive documentation. The result is a garden that reflects vision, responds to nature, and remains maintainable for everyone involved.
