## Garden Scenarios & Seasonal Experiences *(mandatory)*

<!--
  Prioritise scenarios that describe how the garden should feel or perform for people, pollinators, and wildlife.
  Each scenario must be independently achievable so the garden can deliver value even if only that scenario is completed.
-->

### Scenario 1 – [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe the experience: who uses the space, when, and why.]

**Why it matters**: [Explain the value to gardeners, visitors, or ecology.]

**Independent Observation**: [How to confirm this scenario succeeds on its own (e.g., "Evening seating area is comfortable in summer with fragrant herbs in bloom").]

**Seasonal Markers**:
1. **Spring** – [Expected state or bloom sequence]
2. **Summer** – [Expected state or activity]
3. **Autumn/Winter** – [Expected interest or maintenance outcome]

**Why it matters**: [...]

**Independent Observation**: [...]

**Seasonal Markers**:
1. **Spring** – [...]
2. **Summer** – [...]
3. **Autumn/Winter** – [...]

**Independent Observation**: [...]

**Seasonal Markers**:
1. **Spring** – [...]

[Add additional scenarios as required, keeping priorities unique.]

### Edge Conditions

- What happens during [extreme weather condition]?
- How does the garden respond if [pest or wildlife pressure] increases?
- What is the contingency plan for [resource constraint, e.g., water restrictions]?

## Garden Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  Replace the placeholder bullets with the requirements that must be honoured for this garden to succeed.
  Phrase each requirement so a gardener can verify it outdoors.
-->

### Site Requirements

- **SR-001**: Soil in [zone/bed] must [condition, e.g., "maintain pH between 6.2 and 6.8"].
- **SR-002**: Drainage for [area] must [outcome].
- **SR-003**: Access paths must [width, surfacing, accessibility rule].
- **SR-004**: Shade structures or existing canopy must [guideline].
- **SR-005**: Irrigation must deliver [litres/gallons] per [timeframe] with minimal runoff.

*Example clarification marker:*  
- **SR-006**: Rainwater catchment capacity must be [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: confirm target capacity or alternative watering strategy].

### Planting & Habitat Requirements

- **PH-001**: Plant palette for [zone] must include [pollinator/native/edible goals].
- **PH-002**: Companion planting rules for [crop group] must be respected.
- **PH-003**: Wildlife habitat elements (e.g., bird baths, insect hotels) must be placed at [locations].
- **PH-004**: Seasonal colour or harvest must be evident during [months].

### Stewardship Requirements

- **ST-001**: Mulch depth maintained at [depth] throughout [season].
- **ST-002**: Pruning schedule for [specimen] follows [guideline].
- **ST-003**: Compost management must produce [result] by [time].
- **ST-004**: Safety protocols require [protective gear / signage] for [task].

## Key Elements & Features *(use when the garden has notable elements)*

- **[Element 1]**: [What it represents, e.g., "Raised cedar beds: 1.2 m wide, 3 m long, sun-facing."]
- **[Element 2]**: [Relationships, e.g., "Pergola adjacent to seating area, supports climbing roses and grapes."]

---

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: [Example: "Harvest at least 20 kg of produce from the main kitchen beds between June and September."]
- **SC-002**: [Example: "Maintain continuous blooms for pollinators from early spring to first frost."]
- **SC-003**: [Example: "Reduce potable water use by 40% through rainwater harvesting."]
- **SC-004**: [Example: "Achieve 90% volunteer satisfaction in seasonal surveys."]

### Observation Log Prompts

- Record first bloom date for [feature plant].
- Log wildlife sightings (type, frequency) in [zone].
- Note any soil texture changes after heavy rain.

---

## Assumptions

- [List any assumptions made about budget, labour availability, or community expectations. Remove this section if unused.]

---

## Open Questions

1. [Question about zoning, regulations, or priorities. Maximum three.]
2. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker references go here if responses are required.]
