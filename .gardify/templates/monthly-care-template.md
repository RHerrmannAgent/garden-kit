### Guidance

- **Focus & Timing**: mention peak windows (e.g., “First two weeks”, “After frost date”).
- **Detailed Tasks**: list actionable bullet points, identifying prerequisites (“Flush drip lines”, “Prune roses to 5 buds”).
- **Zones / Beds**: refer to plan zones or specific beds.
- **Required Tools & Materials**: cross-reference `tools.md`; flag shortages early.
- **Responsible**: assign individuals, teams, or AI assistant workflows.
- **Expected Outcome / Measure**: define completion criteria (e.g., “Beds mulched to 5 cm”, “Compost pile reaches 60°C”).
- **Notes & Contingencies**: include weather backup plans, dependencies, or observation reminders.

Update this plan at the start of each season and after significant changes to the garden. Use it to drive `/gardenkit.tasks`, volunteer schedules, and long-term maintenance planning.
